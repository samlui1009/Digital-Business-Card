                <p>As a former healthcare and genetics professional pivoting into the technology sector, I bring
                    a unique skillset that encompasses technical aptitude, a penchant for solving complex problems, 
                    and a passion for continued learning. I hope to one day make monumental changes and lasting positive 
                    impact to the digital health space.
