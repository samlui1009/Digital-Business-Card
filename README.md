# Digital Business Card
The purpose of this miniature project is to create a lightweight digital business card that can be used as a convenient, sustainable way to exchange contact information and promote my professional identity. 

## Tech Stack
This business card project is one amongst many assignments from the Scrimba Full-Stack Developer course that aims to help young tech enthusiasts become proficient in frameworks and languages that are commonly used, such as HTMl5, CSS3, JavaScript and React + Vite.

<p>My business card was built with multiple components, which includes a section containing my profile picture, relevant tagline of my prior experiences and a short "About Me" paragraph.</p>
